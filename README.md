Not much to see here yet :( Check back soon!
## TODO ##

* Improve index.html for viewing on mobile and desktop (a.k.a. learn bootstrap)
* Add ability to send to multiple arduinos
* Add ability to do patterns instead of just on/off
* Actually wire up the 4 LED strips and control them
* Put Duo 2FA in the auth path (could just be 1FA in this case xD)
* Add hardware list, setup process, and overall description here for others to use.
