Not much to see here yet :( Check back soon!
## TODO ##

* Improve index.html for viewing on mobile first (a.k.a. learn bootstrap)
* Use AJAX requests instead of redirecting/reloading the page
* Add ability to do patterns instead of just on/off (partially implemented,
                                                     but could use more fine grained control)
* Control 2 sets of LED strands to be able to behave independently
* Put Duo 2FA in the auth path (could just be 1FA in this case xD)
* Add hardware list, setup process, and overall description here for others to use.
